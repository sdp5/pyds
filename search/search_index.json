CH 0: Organization of Chapters Three things required to build good understanding of data structure are: How the information is arranged in the memory of the computer? Become familiar with the algorithms for manipulating the information contained in the data structure. Understand the performance characteristics of the data structure. to select a suitable data structure for a particular application. Definitions Recursion is the process of defining a function or calculating a number by the repeated application of an algorithm. Backtracking The solution process consists of working through a sequence of decision points in which each choice leads further along some path (example Trees or Graphs). In case of incorrect choice somewhere along the way, developer has to backtrack to a previous decision point and try a different path. Backtracking algorithms use this approach, moreover, it's a form of recursion. Linked Lists (dynamic) Number of nodes can grow and shrink on demand. Used to create trees, graphs, hashing, etc. Stacks (abstract) A container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in-first-out LIFO principle. Applications: Internal creation of function parameters and local variables. Compiler's syntax check for matching braces; Support for recursion. Can act as an auxiliary data structure for other abstract data types. Queues (abstract) Similar to stacks but follow FIFO . Applications: In OS, for controlling access to shared system resources such as printers, files, communication lines, disks and tapes. Computer systems must often provide a holding area buffer for messages between two processes, two programs, or even two systems. Can act as an auxiliary data structure for other abstract data types. Trees (abstract) Data organization to make the data insertion or deletion or search faster. Applications: Library db, School's student db, employ or patient db; any db would be implemented using trees. OS file systems; Can act as an auxiliary data structure for other abstract data types. Tree variants are classified by the number of children and the way of interconnecting them. Priority Queues (abstract) Maintain a collection of prioritized elements. Application: operating systems often use a priority queue for the ready queue of processes to run on the CPU. Graphs (fundamental - non linear) Collection of nodes vertices and their connections edges . Used to model many types of relations and processes. Disjoint Set (abstract) Collection of disjoint sets partition . Example: Motorola , YouTube , and Android are all members of the Google set. Two operations: Union: merging of two sets into one! Find Query: takes an item and returns which set it belongs to. Application: Maze generation and Kruskal's algo for computing the minimum spanning tree of a graph. Sorting Arranges the elements of a list in a certain order; sometimes reduces the complexity of problem significantly. Applications: searching elements and db algorithms. Searching The process of finding an item with specified properties from a collection of items. Data organization improves the searching process. Selection Algo ( k th order statistic) Finding the minimum, maximum and median elements in a given list. Symbol Tables (dictionaries) Examples: spelling checker, data dictionary found in DBMS, symbol tables generated by loaders, assemblers, and compilers, as well as routing tables in networking components (DNS Lookup). Hashing Technique used for storing and retrieving information as fast as possible. Used in optimal search and symbol tables. The worst case complexity of hashing is O(n), but it gives O(1) on the average. String Algo Operations like auto completion (on CLI or browser) or string matching need a data structure which stores the string data efficiently. Algo Design Techniques There are different ways of classifying the algorithms like Greedy, Divide and Conquer, and Dynamic Programming. Greedy Algo ( single-minded algorithm) Process that looks for a simple, easy to implement solutions to complex, multi-step problems by deciding which next step will provide the most obvious benefit. Example: selection sort, Prim's algorithms, Kruskal's algorithms, Dijkstra algorithm, Huffman coding algorithm etc. Divide and Conquer Principles: (examples include binary search, merge sort, etc.) Divide - break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size. Conquer - solve the subproblems recursively. Base case - If the subproblem size is small enough then solve the subproblem directly without more recursion. Combine - the solutions to create a solution for the original problem. Dynamic Programming (optimization over plain recursion) Breaking down a complex problem into a collection of simpler subproblems. Solving each of those and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map, etc). Complexity Classes (resources required during computation - time vs space) Classification is done based on the running time (or memory) that an algorithm takes for solving the problem. Bit-wise Hacking Applications: Kind of file format or network protocol that uses individual bits or group of bits to represent pieces of information. Setting individual pixels on the screen by directly manipulating the video memory, where every pixel's color is represented by 1 or 4 bits. Compute some kind of checksum (possibly, parity or CRC) or hash value.","title":"Notes"},{"location":"notes/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"notes/#ch-1-introduction","text":"","title":"CH 1: Introduction"},{"location":"notes/#11-variables","text":"Variables are names (x and y) of the placeholders for representing data.","title":"1.1 Variables"},{"location":"notes/#12-data-types","text":"A set of data with predefined values, example: integer, floating point, unit number, character, string, etc. In memory we combine 2 bytes (16 bits) and call it an integer.

Based on Tuples from set theory. They are one of the oldest, most commonly used data structure. What you need to know Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting (except at the end). Linear Arrays , or one dimensional arrays are the most basic. Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size. Dynamic Arrays are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements. If a dynamic array is full, it copies it's contents to a larger array. Two Dimensional Arrays have x and y indices like a grid or nested arrays. Big O Efficiency Indexing Linear Array: O(1), Dynamic Array: O(1) Search Linear Array: O(n), Dynamic Array: O(n) Optimized Search Linear Array: O(log n), Dynamic Array: O(log n) Insertion Linear Array: N/A, Dynamic Array: O(n) Linked List Definition Stores data with nodes that points to other nodes. Nodes, at its most basic it has one datum and one reference (another node). A linked list chains nodes together by pointing one node's reference towards another node. What you need to know Designed to optimize insertion and deletion, slow at indexing and searching. Doubly linked list has nodes that reference the previous node. Circular linked list is simple linked list whose tail , the last node, references the head , the first node. Stack , commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too. Stack are last in, first out (LIFO) data structures. Made with a linked list by having the head be the only place for insertion and removal. Queues , too can be implemented with an linked list or an array. Queues are a first in, first out (FIFO) data structure. Made with a doubly linked list that only removes from head and adds to tail. Big O Efficiency Indexing Linked Lists: O(n) Search Linked Lists: O(n) Optimized Search Linked Lists: O(n) Insertion Linked Lists: O(1) Hash Table or Hash Map Definition Stores data with key value pairs. Hash functions accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key. This is known as hashing , which is the concept that an input and an output have a one-to-one correspondence to map information. Hash functions return a unique address in memory for that data. What you need to know Designed to optimize searching, insertion, and deletion Hash collisions are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs. All hash functions have this problem. This is often accommodated for by having the hash tables be very large. Hashes are important for associated arrays and database indexing. Big O Efficiency Indexing Hash Tables: O(1) Search Hash Tables: O(1) Insertion Hash Tables: O(1) Binary Tree Definition Is a tree like data structure where every node has at most two children. There is one left and right child node. What you need to know Designed to optimize searching and sorting. A degenerate tree is an unbalanced tree, which if entirely one-sided is an essentially a linked list. They are comparably simple to implement than other data structures. Used to make binary search trees . A binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direction a child is. Left child has a key smaller than it's parent node. Right child has a key greater than it's parent node. There can be no duplicate node. Because of the above it is more likely to be used as a data structure than a binary tree. Big O Efficiency Indexing Binary Search Tree: O(log n) Search Binary Search Tree: O(log n) Insertion Binary Search Tree: O(log n) Search Basics Breadth First Search Definition An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching levels of the tree first, starting at the root. It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left to right. While doing this, it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current level. When finishing examining a level it moves to the left most node on the next level. The bottom-right most node is evaluated last (the node that is deepest and is farthest right of it's level). What you need to know Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than it is deep. Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree. Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than depth first search . The queue uses more memory because it needs to store pointers. Big O Efficiency Search Breadth First Search: O(|E| + |V|) E is number of edges V is number of vertices Depth First Search An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching depth of the tree first, starting at the root. It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go further. Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right child of nodes on that branch, and if possible left from that right children. When finished examining a branch it moves to the node right of the root then tries to go left on all it's children until it reaches the bottom. The right most node is evaluated last (the node that is right of all it's ancestors). What you need to know Optimal for searching a tree that is deeper than it is wide. Uses a stack to push nodes onto. Because a stack is LIFO it does not need to keep track of the nodes pointers and is therefore less memory intensive than breadth first search . Once it cannot go further left it begins evaluating the stack. Big O Efficiency Search Depth First Search: O(|E| + |V|) E is number of edges. V is number of vertices. Breadth First Search Vs Depth First Search The simple to this question is that it depends on the size and shape of the tree. For wide, shallow trees use Breadth First Search For deep, narrow trees use Depth First Search Nuances: Because BFS uses queues to store information about the nodes and it's children, it could use more memory than is available on your computer. (But you probably won't have to worry about this.) If using a DFS on a tree that is very deep you might go unnecessarily deep in the search. Breadth First Search tends to be a looping algorithm. Depth First Search tends to be a recursive algorithm.","title":"Quick Review"},{"location":"review/#data-structure-basics","text":"","title":"Data Structure Basics"},{"location":"review/#arrays","text":"","title":"Arrays"},{"location":"review/#definition","text":"Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0 based, index.
